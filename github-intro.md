# Intro to Github

## Foxtrot's first github extravaganza!

# Git Process

- Created a repo 
- Cloned a repo --> there is a repo on Github and you need it locally
-   local --> your computer
-   remote --> github, the cloud...

- Make a file --> touch <new-file-name> mkae sure you have an extension
    - Make sure you are inside the repo --> cd <repo-name>
    - Naming conventions --> lowercase, no spaces
    - Extensions --> which type of file 

- Added content
- Added the PAT authentification (token)

- Local --> remote 
    - git status
    - git add .  (sidenote: you can do git add <file-name>)
    - git commit -m "message" --> like a patch note. Make it so others and your future self know what this commit actually did.
    - git push origin <branch-name>
