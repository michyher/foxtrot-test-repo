// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding Conceptual Questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.

// --------------------INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What will this log?
const colors = ["tangerine", "magenta", "lilac", "daffodil"]
// console.log(colors.push("indigo"))

// a) Your answer:
// b) Verify and explain:


// --------------------1) What will this log?

const cohort = "LEARN 2022"
// console.log(cohort.length)

// a) Your answer: This is going to give the number of characters within the string, which would be 10.
// b) Verify and explain: My answer was correct because .length counts the amount of characters in a string.


// --------------------2) What will this log?

const greeting = "Hello World!"
// console.log(greeting[4])

// a) Your answer: I think that this is going to output the character o.
// b) Verify and explain: My answer was correct because the 4 within the brackets is referring to index 4 within the string "Hello World" which is the charcter o.


// --------------------3) What will this log?

const languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
const index = 1
// console.log(languages[index])

// a) Your answer: I think that the output is going to be the string Ruby.
// b) Verify and explain: My answer was correct because since the array of strings only has 4 indexes. So when index is 1, the string "Ruby" would be the output.


// --------------------4) What will this log?

const weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
// console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// a) Your answer: This would make the output be SATURDAY SUNDAY.
// b) Verify and explain: I was incorrect because .toUpperCase() is meant to modify a string and not an array. The example shown is an array of strings but not a string.


// --------------------5) What will this log?

const dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean"]
// console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

// a) Your answer: I think that the output would be array 3
// b) Verify and explain: I was incorrect because I didn't know what types of data there were. dataTypes.length means that it's returning a number.
